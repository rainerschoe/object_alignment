# Align a point cloud with another point cloud

## Overview
This is just a small experiment.

Given

- `old_object`: a point cloud (=list of points in 3D space)
- `matching_points` another list of at least 3 points
- a mapping of every point in `matching_point` to a point in `old_point`

this algorithm transforms all points from `old_object` via translation and rotation, such that the distance of mapped points is minimized.


## 2D Example:
Assume five points (0), (1), (2), (3), (4) as follows:
```    
     y ^
       |
      (2)
(3)    |
       |
------(0)--(1)----> x
       |
 (4)   |
       |
       |

```
In 2D we would need only two mapped points. Let's choose (1') and (2') as follows:

```    
     y ^
       |
       | (2')
       |
       |
-------|------(1')-> x
       |
       |
       |
       |

```

The result of the transformation would be:

```    
     y ^
       |
       | (2)
   (3) |
       |
-------|-(0)--(1)----> x
       |
    (4)|
       |
       |

```

## How it works:
Developed using test driven development.

The [tests](test_transform.py) are easy to understand and cover
- translations
- rotations
- combined translations and rotations
- not exact matching mapped points (noise)

The actual logic is then autogenerated using GPT-4.1 / Copilot Agent. I have no idea, what it is doing, but tests pass :-) Says something about "Kabsch algorithm".
